# How to use this image

```console
$ docker container run mybb/mybb:latest
```

This image only provides a MyBB service container running PHP7.X-FPM. There are no database, cache or nginx container(s) provided, you'll need to use Docker Compose or Stack to wrange those additional services to your MyBB instance. Please see the provided mysqli/pgsql Compose example files in the official repository, [here](https://github.com/mybb/docker-compose). A very basic example has also been provided below.

## ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yml` for `mybb`:

```yaml
services:
  mybb:
    build: .
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/mybb:/var/www/html:rw
  nginx:
    image: nginx:mainline
    ports:
    - published: 8080
      target: 80
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/mybb:/var/www/html:ro
  postgresql:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: mybb
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
      POSTGRES_USER: mybb
    image: postgres:10.4
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw
version: '3.6'
```

## Connecting to the database
Once it is running and you are on the MyBB installation page, you can use the following database credentials for connecting.

*Note: this is assuming you are using the above stack.yml / docker-compose file.*


- Database host: `postgresql` (this is from the postgresql service setup in the docker-compose file.
- Database user: `mybb`
- Database password: `changeme`
- Database name: `mybb`
