# How to use this image

## ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yml` for `mybb`:

```yaml
services:
  mybb:
    image: mybb/mybb:latest
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/mybb:/var/www/html:rw

  nginx:
    image: nginx:mainline-alpine
    ports:
    - published: 8080
      target: 80
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro
    - ${PWD}/mybb:/var/www/html:ro

  postgresql:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: mybb
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
      POSTGRES_USER: mybb
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw

version: '3.8'
```

Note, you'll also need a virtual host configuration file for the provided `nginx` container. You can find a very basic example [here](https://gist.github.com/kawaii/ed2fbbf11309b8f635a623fa87abce8d). Create [this file](https://gist.github.com/kawaii/ed2fbbf11309b8f635a623fa87abce8d) as **`./nginx/default.conf`**, respective to the location of your `docker-compose.yml` file.

You should note that static content such as images and JavaScript or CSS files must be cross-mounted between the `mybb` and `nginx` containers - as PHP-FPM is not capable of serving those natively.

# Preserving existing files

If you wish to run this image and preserve any updated `lang` or `config` files, you can add the following flag:

```
docker run mybb/mybb --skip-old-files php-fpm
```

or, within your compose file, specify the following command argument:

```yaml
services:
  mybb:
    image: mybb/mybb:latest
    command: --skip-old-files php-fpm
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/mybb:/var/www/html:rw

    ...
```

# How to build this image

You must provide four build-time arguments when building this Docker image; `BUILD_AUTHORS`, `BUILD_DATE`, `BUILD_SHA512SUM` and `BUILD_VERSION`.
```
docker build \
  --build-arg BUILD_AUTHORS="Kane 'kawaii' Valentine <kawaii@mybb.com>" \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') \
  --build-arg BUILD_SHA512SUM=be3bdec9617050abbabbfcfa40e9cd145db3a57ae70e740bc62d807b04c08a5fa42ac690a5502c344f0f7452276aa0f3802501e6d62fa76edc64ac36da25b3cd \
  --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=1830 \
  --tag mybb/mybb:1.8 \
  --tag mybb/mybb:1.8.30 \
  --tag mybb/mybb:latest \
  $PWD
```
The resulting image can then be pushed to the [`mybb/mybb`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/mybb/repository/docker/mybb/mybb) Docker Hub repository:
```
docker push mybb/mybb:1.8.30
```
